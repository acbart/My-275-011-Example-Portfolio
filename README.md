# Portfolio

I followed Dr. Bart's inclass livecoding session and made a website [here](https://acbart.github.io/my-275-scratch-site-010/). The source code for the site is [here](https://github.com/acbart/my-275-scratch-site-010). I learned about the basics of HTML, making the div tags for each of the buttons.... 

# Changelog

* Added new example website from Dr. Bart's livecoding inclass session

# TODO

* Make Dr. Bart site even cooler with images and videos
